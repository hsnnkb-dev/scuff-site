          <span className="font-wednesday text-2xl">I</span>n the run up to the
          release of their new single, ‘Win a Fortune’, I caught up with
          up-and-coming Leeds band No Cameo, braving a rainstorm to chat in the
          rustic Fenton pub. The venue was the choice of rhythm guitarist and
          vocalist AJ Byrne, picked on the basis that iconic synth-pop duo Soft
          Cell had also once been interviewed within its four walls.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          The Fenton is also where AJ and lead guitarist/No Cameo founder Miles
          O’Sullivan first met, before their inaugural rehearsal with bass
          guitarist and producer Mag Fielding. While No Cameo has been through a
          number of iterations, its current formation sees the band at its best
          yet, with their newest edition of Will Brooke on drums. In the words
          of Mag: “as soon as we had the four elements sorted out, everything
          just fell into place so quickly - just Tetris all the way down.”
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Over beers (and before taking part in a rogue pub quiz), Miles, Mag,
          AJ and I discussed No Cameos’ new single, future plans, the existence
          of God, and whether The Beatles were ever really all that.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2 poppins-extralight-italic">
          You can listen to No Cameo’s new single wherever you stream music,
          including: Spotify, Apple Music and BandCamp. You can also catch them
          playing Live at Leeds in the City on November 15th.

        <div className={subtitleStyling}>
          <h2>Who and what is No Cameo?</h2>
          <h2>How would you describe yourselves as a band?</h2>
        </div>

        <p>
          <span className={artistNameStyling}>AJ</span>: Essentially, we're an
          art punk band. The name came about because we try to keep everything
          in-house, between us and our friends. No Cameo isn’t for anyone else,
          it’s about us, and it’s about an unconventional, arty approach to
          music.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className={sectionStyling}>
        <div className={subtitleStyling}>
          <h2>
            Tell me about your new single, ‘Win a Fortune’{" "}
            <span className="poppins-extralight">-</span> what’s it all about?
          </h2>
        </div>

        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>
          <span className={artistNameStyling}>AJ</span>: The single’s about
          dating in the LGBTQ+ scene. We have a chant for it at gigs - I’m
          trying to make it a thing - where I get everyone to shout “men ain’t
          shit” beforehand. Essentially, I’d say it's the most conventional song
          we have in our set.
        </p>

        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>
          <span className={artistNameStyling}>Mag</span>: It’s the only song
          that survived our experimentation phase, our ‘phase one’. All the
          other songs have been axed and cut.
        </p>

        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>
          <span className={artistNameStyling}>Miles</span>: We spent a long time
          finding our sound, and sometimes thinking that [our first iteration]
          was our sound. And then we realised that we can do better - but that’s
          the song that stayed throughout all that.
        </p>

        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>
          <span className={artistNameStyling}>AJ</span>: We masqueraded as an
          indie band for a bit, but now we’ve realised that we don’t have an
          indie sound, and it’s not an indie song.
        </p>

        <p className={katCommentStyling}>
          No, it's definitely not an indie song. I think if it was going to be
          on Spotify they'd probably just label it as ‘alternative’ because they
          wouldn't know how to categorise it.
        </p>

        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>
          <span className={artistNameStyling}>AJ</span>: Yeah, that’s kind of
          our aim!
        </p>
      </div>

      <div className={sectionStyling}>
        <div className={sectionSubtitleStyling}>
          <h2>
            Who are some of your biggest influences, both as individuals and as
            a band?{" "}
          </h2>
        </div>
        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>
          <span className={artistNameStyling}>Mag</span>: I’ve always been a
          right little pop-head. So, growing up for me, it was 21 Pilots, Fall
          Out Boy, and Gorillaz. I wouldn’t say those bands carry through to my
          influences for No Cameo, but growing up, those were my three core
          bands. As for my influences for No Cameo? I shut up and be a bass
          player!
        </p>
        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>
          We have quite a lot of moments I would describe as a “hear me out”
          moment. Whenever someone says “hear me out”, everyone else has to stop
          and listen to what idea that person has. I feel like a lot of the
          time, we’re following AJ’s vision, or with the newer stuff, Miles too.
          These guys come with an initial idea, and the rest of us will build
          off of that idea and follow them as the leader.
        </p>
        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>
          <span className={artistNameStyling}>AJ</span>: We’ve realised that
          we’re not a band that jamming works for. We don’t describe things as
          ‘verse’, ‘chorus’ or whatever. We’ve changed it to sections, so it’s a
          bit more free flow. It means that if we have at least three
          established sections and we’ve written something, we bring those in
          and we kind of shape it from there.{" "}
        </p>
        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>
          <span className={artistNameStyling}>Mag</span>: We're trying to escape
          the norms of popular music.
        </p>
        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>
          <span className={artistNameStyling}>AJ</span>: I’m glad you told us
          what your influences were though, Mag. So, 21 Pilots and Fall Out
          Boy…?!
        </p>
        <p className={katCommentStyling}>
          We can’t just do Mag’s, I need to hear everybody else's!
        </p>
        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>
          <span className={artistNameStyling}>Miles</span>: Oh, where do I
          start?! I mean, I didn't get into music until a bit later, so that’s
          probably the embarrassing bit - I just pretended to listen to music.
          And then…I listened to Nickelback in the car, and Fall Out Boy was the
          first tape that I got. It was then that I became conscious.
        </p>
        <p className={katCommentStyling}>
          I like that Fall Out Boy seems to be the overriding theme of this
          interview.
        </p>
        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>
          <span className={artistNameStyling}>Miles</span>: We’re a Fall Out Boy
          band!
        </p>
        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>
          <span className={artistNameStyling}>Mag</span>: Fall Out Boy covers
          band, here we go!
        </p>
        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>
          <span className={artistNameStyling}>Miles</span>: 2000s music though,
          I wasn’t too into that. I dug into the 90s, 80s to 60s, and then I
          realised that there's so much more to music than what's happening
          right now. Going forward, you need to look back, not just to what you
          listened to, but what your parents listened to.
        </p>
        <p className={katCommentStyling}>How about you, AJ?</p>
        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>
          <span className={artistNameStyling}>AJ</span>: Back in the day, the
          first album I ever bought was Demon Days by Gorillaz, so it was
          alternative straight away. I did have my dalliances with Fall Out Boy,
          because my sister was really obsessed with them, and a lot of what I
          listened to growing up was a mix between what my parents liked and
          what she liked. In terms of early bands I really like though, I really
          fuck with The Doors, love James Brown, and Gorillaz obviously.
        </p>
        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>
          <span className={artistNameStyling}>Miles</span>: [To AJ] We want
          embarrassing music!
        </p>
        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>
          <span className={artistNameStyling}>AJ</span>: Well, I went and saw
          Back Veil Brides play a gig once. I actually saw them four times. I
          really liked hair metal as a kid, so they were like a hair metal band
          that didn’t look ancient that I could go and see. In terms of bands
          that influence what we do now, I’d say maybe Interpol is a massive
          one, and 90s emotional hardcore stuff like Orchid, Rites of Spring, or
          Fugazi.
        </p>
        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>
          <span className={artistNameStyling}>Mag</span>: More in the Leeds
          local scene, we’ve been looking at a couple of bands like The 113 and
          Mince.

            Leeds has a solid reputation for being a great place to break out in
            music. Do you think that the city has become oversaturated, or do
            you think there's still room to emerge as an artist here?
          </h2>
        </div>
        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>
          <span className={artistNameStyling}>AJ</span>: I don’t think that it’s
          become oversaturated. The issue is that there’s not a lot of variation
          anymore.
        </p>
        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>
          When I first started coming to gigs in Leeds during uni and when I
          first moved to Leeds five years ago, you had bands like Weirds, bands
          like Cattle…you had the early ruminations of bands like English
          Teacher, whereas now it's kind of jumped back to that kind of 2010’s
          vibe where it's like college-level bands just playing the Arctic
          Monkeys’ meets Wunderhorse vibes. Which is great - rep South
          Yorkshire! - but there is a lot of room for improvement in the local
          scene.
        </p>
        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>
          Because the level that it’s at…it’s either that you’re [local venue’s]
          Royal Park Cellars, Pack Horse or Sela’s vibe - which are bands that
          have just started which you don’t really know, which might have a
          great sound but haven’t really established their vibe yet. And then it
          jumps up to a [Hyde Park] Book Club vibe, where you can fill a bigger
          room, and then it jumps up again from there to your Wardrobe’s, your
          Project Houses, your Belgrave’s…I think there’s not a lot of bands
          from Leeds that can fill those spaces, unless they’re already
          established from years ago.
        </p>
        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>
          But the best band in Leeds - I will say this - is Mince. Mince is my
          favorite fucking band in Leeds, I love those guys so much.

        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>

        </p>
        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>
          <span className={artistNameStyling}>Miles</span>: It’s the obvious
          choice, but it’s the place where good bands will play and say how good
          it is, and they will have played there for the third or fourth time.
        </p>
        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>
          <span className={artistNameStyling}>AJ</span>: When I was at uni in
          York, I would commute over to watch bands play at Brude because I knew
          it would be a great place to go. But there’s also the likes of Wharf
          Chambers - they’re great! Belgrave is also great depending on the gig,
          and [Hyde Park] Book Club.

          <span className={artistNameStyling}>Miles</span>: It's so important

        <p className={artistCommentStyling}>

          but a great reputation.

          person - but the Proverbs, and the rules of life that they do teach, I
          do hold on to some of those, like “treat others as you would like to
          be treated.” They do teach generally good values, and I do hold on to
          some of those.
